This repository is for Writing Functions in R course offered by the DASD R Training Group. It was also used for the April 2019 [Coffee & Coding](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/Coffee-and-Coding) session.

Knowing how to write your own functions is a great skill to add to your R toolbox. Writing functions can save you time, reduce the risk of errors, and make your code easier to understand. In this course weâ€™ll cover why, when and how to write your own functions, with plenty of examples & exercises to help you get started.

The session is intended to be accessible to anyone who is familiar with the content of the [Introduction to R](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/IntroRTraining) training session & has some experience of using R in their work.

All the notes for the training session are available below. If you have any feedback on the content, please get in touch!

## Pre-material

A few days before the session, please make sure that -

1. You have access to RStudio on the Analytical Platform
2. You have access to the [alpha-everyone s3 bucket](https://cpanel-master.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/datasources/82/)
3. You have followed the steps in the [Configure Git and Github section of the Platform User Guidance](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/introduction.html#configure-git-and-github) to configure Git and GitHub (this only needs doing once)
4. You have cloned this repository (instructions are in the Analytical Platform User Guidance [here](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/github.html#creating-your-project-repo-on-github))

If you have any problems with the above please get in touch with the course organisers or ask for help on either the #analytical_platform or #intro_r channel on [ASD slack](https://asdslack.slack.com).

All the examples in the presentation/README are available in the R script example_code.R.
