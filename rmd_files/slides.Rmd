## Writing functions in R: setup

Before we start, make sure you've:

1. Got access to the `alpha-r-training` bucket
2. Cloned the `writing_functions_in_r` repo
3. Pulled any changes (the blue arrow on the Git tab in the top right panel)
4. Got `example_code.R` open
5. Opened the `writing_functions_in_r` repo on GitHub, so you can refer to the read me

If you need any help, just ask! For anyone joining remotely, we will be monitoring Skype throughout the session.

Note we will be recording this session for upload later to the R training Microsoft Stream channel.
