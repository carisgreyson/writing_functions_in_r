### Exercise 1
Write a function that takes a number as an input and gives a string as an output where if the number is over a million, for example 1,200,000, then the returned string says "1.2 million", and similar for over a billion.
Hints: combine two strings together using the `paste()` function - eg. `paste("a", "b")`.
